Localization example with real robot.

As a robotics platform this example uses hardware and software we are
developing for our Veter-project:
https://github.com/veter-team/veter/wiki .  This example example
illustrate how to perform one-dimensional localization using histogram
filter we have learned in Unit 1 of the class.
