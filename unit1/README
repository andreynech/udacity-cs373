Localization example with real robot.

As a robotics platform this example uses hardware and software we are
developing for our Veter-project:
https://github.com/veter-team/veter/wiki . This example example
illustrate how to perform one-dimensional localization using histogram
filter we have learned in Unit 1 of the class. In particular, the left
sonar measures the distance at each step. If the distance is less than
threshold (defined as 30cm), then we consider that the measurement
returns "wall". If the distance is larger than than threshold, then we
assume that we are in front of the door.

The one second pause between movements is made intentionally to
highlight that we are not in the continuous space. In practice, it
might be well possible not to stop motors at the moment where
measurements are made. In fact, it is very easy to modify the source
code by commenting out corresponding sleep call to achieve "smooth"
movement.
